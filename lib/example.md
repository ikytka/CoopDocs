# LearningJS - Readme

Hi! Im **Petr** and Im going to study **JavaScript**.

I have chosen 2 books which Im going to read through and Im going to save all of my **practice code** here in this particular GitHub Repository.

I will also include **notes** from my study sessions.

Feel free to change them, or post a comment.

### Progress
**Eloquent Javascript:** 0 out of 21 chapters finished.

**Pro JS for Web Developers:** 0 out of 24 chapters finished.


### Books Im talking about

[Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net) - Which is also a good introduction to programming.

and

[Professional JavaScript for Web Developers](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1118026691) - This one is more thorough, but less understandable. Its for more experienced JS developers and is also a good reference book.

### Process

Im going to start with [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net). It has god a **21 Chapters**. I want to deal with it in a chapter per dey progress. You can follow if Im on track by watching my commits. Although I want to stick to this plan, there will be maybe some less digestible chapters which Im not going to be able to finish in a day. Im not going to stress about it and as far as Im working all 21 days in a row Im fine.

Im going to start at 1st of October and my estimate is I will be finished with this book by 23rd.

Ok, lets Go!
